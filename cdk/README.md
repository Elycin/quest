# Rearc Quest CDK

This implements the resources for this repository in AWS Flavor. 

## Why CDK?
CDK and Cloudformation are the current IaC tools that I work with in my career which defines my choice to use these.


## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
